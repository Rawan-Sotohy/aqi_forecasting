# 🌫️ Air Quality (AQI) Forecasting System

A deep learning-based system for predicting air pollution levels (PM2.5) using LSTM neural networks. This project demonstrates time-series forecasting with real-world environmental data.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This system analyzes historical air quality data and predicts future PM2.5 concentration levels using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model considers multiple environmental factors including pollutants, weather conditions, and temporal patterns.

## 📊 Dataset

**US Pollution Data**
   - **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution
   - Coverage: Major US cities (2000-2016)

---
### ✨ Key Features

-  **LSTM-based time series forecasting** for air quality prediction
-  **30-day lookback window** for sequential pattern learning
-  **Single pollutant focus** (O3/NO2/CO concentration)
-  **Interactive Streamlit web interface** with 3 input modes
-  **Multi-step forecasting** (1-14 days ahead)
-  **Comprehensive data visualization** (EDA, training history, predictions)
-  **Model performance tracking** (MAE, RMSE, R² metrics)
-  **CSV upload support** for custom data forecasting
-  **Demo mode** with sample data generation
